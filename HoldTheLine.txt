Its not in the way that you hold me
Its not in the way you say you care
Its not in the way you have been treating my friends
Its not in the way you look or the things that you say that you do
Hold the line
Love isnt always on time
Whoa oh oh
Hold the line
Love isnt always on time
Whoa oh oh
Its not in the words that you told me
Its not in the way you say you are mine
Its not in the way that you came back to me
Its not in the way that your love set me free
Its not in the way that you look or the things that you say that you do
Hold the line
Love isnt always on time
Whoa oh oh
Hold the line
Love isnt always on time
Whoa oh oh
Its not in the words that you told me
Its not in the way you say you are mine oooh
Its not in the way that you came back to me
Its not in the way that your love set me free
Its not in the way you look or the things that you say that you do
Love isnt always on time
Whoa oh oh
Hold the line
Love isnt always on time
Whoa oh oh
Hold the line
Love isnt always on time
Love isnt always on time
Love isnt always on time
Love isnt always on time
Woah oh oh
