Oh joys arise
The sun has come again to hold you
Sailing out the doldrums of the week
The polyphonic prayer is here
Its all around you
Its all around you out here
And if the whole world is crashing down on you
Fall through space out of mind with me
Where the emptiness we leave behind on warm air rising
Blows all shadows far away
The falling of the whole empire is here to hold you
Rolling our and haunted till it sleeps
Little memories marching on
Your little feet working the machine
Say will it spin will it soar
My little dream working the machine
Soon like a wave that pass will fall
And closing in on you they are going on
Little memories
Your little feet working the machine
Say will it spin will it soar
My little dream working the machine
Soon like a wave that pass will fall
And closing in on you they are going on
