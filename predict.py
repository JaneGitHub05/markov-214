# GOAL: Generate line of n words given an initial word + track runtime between two solutions

# Functionality: 
# 1. Take in transformation matrix and an input state
# 2. Predict resultant state after n steps using - 
# TODO: Solution 1: for-loop OR recursive

# TODO: Solution 2: Diagonalize, then raise to power
