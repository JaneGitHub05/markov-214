Aint no sunshine when shes gone
Its not warm when shes away
Aint no sunshine when shes gone
And shes always gone too long
Anytime she’s gone away
Wonder this time where shes gone
Wonder if shes gone to stay
Aint no sunshine when shes gone
And this house just aint no home
Any time she goes away
And I know I know I know I know 
Hey I oughta leave young thing alone
But aint no sunshine when shes gone whoa whoa
Aint no sunshine when she’s gone
Only darkness every day
Aint no sunshine when she’s gone
And this house just aint no home
Any time she goes away
Any time she goes away
Any time she goes away
