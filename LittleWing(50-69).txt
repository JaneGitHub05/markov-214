Well she is walking through the clouds
With a circus mind that is running wild
Butterflies and zebras and moonbeams
And her fairy tales
That is all she ever thinks about
Riding with the wind

When I am sad she comes to me
With a thousand smiles she gives to me
It is alright she says its alright
Take anything you want from me
Anything

Fly on little wing
