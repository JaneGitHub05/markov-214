Sun is shining the weather is sweet
Make you want to move your dancing feet
To the rescue here I am
Want you to know yall can you understand
When the mornin gather the rainbow
What you to know I am a rainbow too
To the rescue here I am
Want you to know yall can you understand
Sun is shining the weather is sweet
Make you want to move your dancing feet
To the rescue here I am
Want you to know just if you can here I stand
Oh no no no no no no
Can you understand me now baby
Do you believe me
