All the leaves are brown
And the sky is gray
I have been for a walk
On a winters day
I would be safe and warm
If I was in LA
California dreamin
On such a winters day
Stopped into a church
I passed along the way
Well I got down on my knees
And I began to Pray
You know the preacher likes the cold
He knows I am gonna stay
California dreaming
On such a winters day
