In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines
So we sailed onto the sun
Til we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine yellow submarine
And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine yellow submarine
Full speed ahead Mr Boatswain full speed ahead
Full speed ahead it is Sgt
Cut the cable drop the cable
Aye sir aye
Captain captain
As we live a life of ease
Everyone of us has all we need
Sky of blue and sea of green
In our yellow submarine
