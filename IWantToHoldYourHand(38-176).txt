Oh yeah I will tell you something
I think you will understand
When I say that something
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
Oh please say to me
And let me be your man
And please say to me
You will let me hold your hand
Oh let me hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
And when I touch you I feel happy inside
Its such a feeling that my love
I cant hide
I cant hide
I cant hide
Yeah you have got that something
When I say that something
I want to hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
And when I touch you I feel happy inside
Its such a feeling that my love
I cant hide
I cant hide
Yeah you have got that something
I think you will understand
When I feel that something
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
